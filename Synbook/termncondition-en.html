					</ol>
				</li>

					<ol>
						<li>	In general, all fees for purchases are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may make an exception if a refund is requested for a subscription offer within fourteen days of the date of the transaction or if the laws in your jurisdiction provide for refunds based on revocation exercised in a timely manner (such as in the EU).</li>
						<li>	You have the right, if provided in your jurisdiction, to revoke this Agreement within fourteen (14) days of the date of purchase without giving any reason. In order to exercise the right of withdrawal, you must provide us with a clear statement of your decision to withdraw from this Agreement. You may use the sample withdrawal form below, but this is not mandatory. In order to comply with the withdrawal period, it is sufficient for you to send the notification of exercising the right of withdrawal before the expiry of the withdrawal period.</li>
						<li>	Refunds will be made through your store, e.g. Apple via "Report a Problem" or <a href="https://getsupport.apple.com">https://getsupport.apple.com</a> or Google via Customer Service and with your order number or by post with your email address or phone number, your account together with your order number. Alternatively, you can also notify us of the revocation using the following sample:
